# [LINUX] Mod Renamer
A small script to rename all mod files to filenames compatible with linux systems. This will rename ALL file structures beginning with `@` to lowercase and remove any special characters and whitespace.

## Usage
In the root mod folder (default the Arma3 Server directory) run the following:
- `python rename.py`

It can take a few seconds to complete.
